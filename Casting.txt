  conversion-
  
  Converting one type of information into another is called as "Casting in Java".
  
  1) Primitive Data-type casting-
  
  
  
  a) implicit casting-
  
  to convert lower type of data to higher type of data is nothing but "implicit type casting".
  Java support implicit type casting.
  
  ex-
  package ExceptionalHandling;

public class Casting {
	
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
    //Data type 
		//Lower size
		int y=19;
		
		//Higher size
		double d =y;
		
		
		
		//int 19----->double d
		//This is called ass implcit type of casting
		
		System.out.println(d);
		
		
	}

}
o/p-19.0
  
  
  
  b) explicit casting-
  
  
  conversion of data from higher to lower is nothing but "Explicit Casting".
  
  In this type of acsting there may chance of losing data.
  
  ex-
  package ExceptionalHandling;

public class Casting {
	
	

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
    //Data type 
	
		
		//Higher size-
		double d =125.55;
		
		//Lower size
		int i=(int)d;
		
		
		
		//double d----->int i
		//This is called ass explicit type of casting
		
		System.out.println(i);
		
		
	}

}



Note- boolean type data are not comatible with type casting
  
  
  

2) Class or OBject type casting-


1) Upcasting ------parent to child property convert


2) Down casting---------child to parent convert

Java does not support the down casting.

ex-
package ExceptionalHandling;

public class Casting2 extends Casting {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		//Casting2 c=new Casting2();
		
		Casting c=new Casting2();
		//Casting2-->sub-class
		//casting --> super class
		//conversion from sub-class --> super class
		//Up casting in java
		
		
		//Down casting
		Casting2 c1=new Casting();//Will get the compile time error
		
	}

}
